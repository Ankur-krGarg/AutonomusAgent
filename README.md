# Autonomous AI Agent System

This project implements a fully autonomous AI agent capable of task planning, dynamic tool usage, and iterative reasoning using LLMs. It simulates real-world autonomy in agents — from goal breakdown to execution — using modern agentic design principles.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- ✅ Goal-driven autonomous behavior without human intervention
- 🔁 Multi-step task planning using a ReAct-style framework
- 🧠 Integration of LLMs for dynamic reasoning and decision making
- 🛠️ Tool-use execution with intermediate memory and contextual awareness
- 📦 Modular and extensible for future tools or reasoning layers

## 🧰 Core Tech Stack

- Python + LangChain
- OpenAI / Local LLMs (pluggable)
- LangChain Agents (ReAct framework)
- Custom Toolkits
- Async task handling

## 📌 What You’ll See

This project shows how a modern AI system can:
- Interpret complex prompts or objectives
- Create its own sub-tasks
- Select appropriate tools
- Loop until a final result is achieved — all autonomously

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case Potential

- AI customer support agents
- Automated research agents
- Workflow assistants
- Autonomous taskbots for productivity
